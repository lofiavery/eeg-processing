# With this script you can first epoch and then average your cleaned data. Epoching in EEG refers to the process of
# selecting important events from your experiment and creating little slices of data around these events.
# In principle, you cut out the small pieces of signal that ineterst you. This example will be performed with onsets
# of different music stimuli. The data set in question contained the presentation of six second music stimuli
# of different genres.
